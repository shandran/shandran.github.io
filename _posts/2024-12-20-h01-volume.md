# Finding a needle in a petabyte haystack...

Two mitochondria appear to be in the end stages of fission. Viewing the z-plane above and below the current plane of focus shows that there is a thin bit of membrane connecting the two mitochondria together. Mitochondria are dynamic, moving along the cytoskeleton, fusing together and breaking apart. This dynamic transition is frozen in time here in this fixed electron micrograph.
