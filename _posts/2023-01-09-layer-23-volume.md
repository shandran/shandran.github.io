### Over a century ago, Golgi and Cajal revolutionized the field of neuroscience

For an intriguing summary of this revolution, read Mitch Glickstein's [**essay**](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(06)01203-6.pdf) on Golgi and Cajal in <em>Cell</em>.

<em>Image credit: I created this serial LM reconstruction of a Golgi-stained mouse pyramidal neuron using a Zeiss Photomicroscope II at 40x oil and Smart Objects in Photoshop.</em>

### Once again neuroscience is undergoing another revolution with the serial electron microscope brain reconstructions

Petabytes of data have been generated for small volumes (1 cubic mm or less) of human, mouse, songbird, and fly brain volumes. This gargantuan task has been spearheaded by investigators from a variety of entities, including Allen Institute, Baylor, Columbia, Google Research, Harvard, IARPA, Janelia/HHMI, Johns Hopkins, Max Planck Institute, Princeton, Rice, and the University of Cambridge, among others.
