# Instructions
These files can be opened and run in Google Colab. When clicking on a link below for the first time, you will see a bunch of code appearing in a new web browser window (don't be alarmed by this). Sign in to your school-linked Google account by pressing the *Sign In* button (if you not already signed into your Google account). Be sure to sign into your school-linked Google account in order to be able to be connected to your school's learning management system. Once you are signed in, press the *Open in Google Colaboratory* button in the top middle of the browser window. Then save a copy to your own Google Drive from the file menu: *File > Save a copy in Drive*  

You are now ready to use and modify this notebook according to your teacher's instructions and any changes you make will be automatically saved to the *Colab Notebooks* folder of your Google Drive.
